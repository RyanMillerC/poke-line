![Demo GIF](/docs/demo.gif)

Select from all 890 different Pokemon! Change Pokemon on the fly! Set a
different Pokemon for each mode!

## Installation

I highly recommended installing poke-mode with
[use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package):

```elisp
(use-package poke-mode
  :ensure t)
```

Alternatively, this package can be installed with package-install
and included in your initial config with:

```elisp
(require 'poke-mode)
```

## Usage

poke-mode can be activated with:

```elisp
(poke-mode 1)
```

The active pokemon can be swapped out at any time with:

```elisp
(set-pokemon "charmander")
```

Easily set the default Pokemon in your config with use-package:

```elisp
(use-package poke-mode
  :ensure t
  :config
  (set-pokemon "gengar"))
```

See [this page](docs/pokemon.md) for a list of available Pokemon.

## Customization

poke-mode allows for two custom variables to be set. If either variable is
updated after starting poke-mode, `poke-refresh` must be called to refresh
their values them.

### poke-minimum-window-width

Minimum width of the window, below which poke-mode will not be displayed. This
is important because poke-mode will push out all informations from small
windows.

```elisp
(setq poke-minimum-window-width 64)
```

### poke-bar-length

Length of Poke element bar in units.  Each unit is equal to an 8px image.
Minimum of 3 units are required for poke-mode.

```elisp
(setq poke-bar-length 32)
```
